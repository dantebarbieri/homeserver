# homeserver

Monorepo for my NixOS-based home server infrastructure. 50+ Docker containers, NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER for transcoding/ML, ~66TB RAID6 XFS storage, reverse-proxied via [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) SSO.

## Repository Layout

```
docker/              Docker Compose orchestration (18 category files)
nixos/               NixOS system configuration (configuration.nix)
homepage/            Homepage dashboard YAML config
mail-config/         Optional legacy terminal mail/calendar config (not installed on server)
recyclarr-configs/   TRaSH Guides quality profiles for Sonarr/Radarr
production-configs/  Gitignored production config copies for debugging
```

## How It Works

**NixOS** is the declarative OS layer — it manages the Docker daemon, a daily auto-update timer, RAID/drive health monitoring, and SSH. Terminal mail/calendar tooling and its synchronization timer have been retired; existing data is preserved.

**Docker Compose** is the service orchestration layer. `docker-compose.yml` uses the `include:` directive to pull in self-contained category files (`compose.*.yml`). Each category can run independently. Services extend from shared base templates in `compose.common.yml`.

**Daily auto-update** (04:00): a NixOS systemd timer pulls this repo and runs `docker compose pull && build && up -d`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:dantebarbieri/homeserver.git
z homeserver

# Configure environment (see sample.env for all variables)
cp docker/sample.env docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env with your paths, credentials, and API keys

# Start everything
z docker
docker compose up -d

# Start a single service using the main index (preserves shared networks)
docker compose up -d plex

# Validate config
docker compose config
```

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Starr installer hosting

For a fresh Linux server without NixOS, use the independent public
[Starr installer source](https://github.com/dantebarbieri/starr-installer) and
[installer documentation](https://github.com/dantebarbieri/starr-installer#readme).
The planned [hosted guide and command builder](https://starr.danteb.com)
also serves `/install.sh` and `/install.py`. **The public hostname is not
deployed yet.**

This repository only hosts the installer using
`ghcr.io/dantebarbieri/starr-installer:latest`. Required checks and gated image
publication belong to the installer repository; the first deployment depends
on its tested image being published and anonymously pullable. The existing
homeserver updater can then pull new published images. The image bundles its
source and public profile snapshot at `/source` (`SOURCE_ROOT`); the authoritative
Recyclarr profiles remain here in `recyclarr-configs/`. There are no runtime
source/profile mounts, Docker socket access, or host ports. The image's own
entrypoint runs as UID/GID 65534 with a read-only filesystem.

When ready to deploy, run from the main Compose entry point, not the websites
category file, so NPM and `starr` share the existing proxy network:

```bash
z /srv/homeserver/docker
docker compose pull starr
docker compose up -d starr
```

In Nginx Proxy Manager, create `starr.danteb.com` with HTTP upstream
`starr:8080`, a TLS certificate, and Force SSL. Keep `PUBLIC_URL` set to
`https://starr.danteb.com`. Do not add Authelia or a login access list: the guide
and installer downloads are intentionally public, read-only resources with no
accounts or privileged API. Health checks use `/healthz`; Homepage monitors
that URL and the `starr` container. No NixOS, router or firewall changes are
needed because NPM provides the existing HTTPS ingress.

For music, see [Lidarr + Plexamp](docker/docs/MUSIC.md): a shared FLAC library,
lossless download stores, and iPhone/Windows/macOS playback using the existing
Plex server.
